Data set Evaluation: A brief (250-500 words) that evaluates a data set with respect to one of the FAIR principles, 
and best practices for data publishing more generally. In the write-up, you might reflect on the challenges that 
a user of the data set might encounter, or suggest changes to the data set's documentation or metadata with a view 
towards enhancing its reusability for future users.

Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles describe best practices on how to 
manage research data. These principles reflect a shift in values among researchers from a highly protective and 
competetive system to a more collaborative and supportive system. We aim to share data to improve science with 
respect to rigor and reproducibility, but more importantly, to drive discovery.

The data set used in this repository is only accessible to members of the lab which produced it and not findable 
by any other potential users. The data are not accompanied by a README to describe the cryptic row and column names.
This .csv file is formatted in a very usable way for reading into any script, thus is interoperable.
